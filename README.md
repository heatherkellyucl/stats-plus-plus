# stats-plus-plus
My latest attempt to have some useful stats tools for our services.

This is a set of tools that can hopefully be used to write useful just in time stats programs to fulfil the arbitrary requirements we sometimes get.  I'm basing it on the stuff I did in the tailoredrcstats (https://github.com/UCL-RITS/tailoredrcstats) package with the aim of having a more generic set of stuff.
